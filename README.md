Overall Vision: 
        The overarching vision for EcoFinds is to create a vibrant and trusted 
platform that revolutionizes the way people buy and sell pre-owned goods. It aims to 
foster a culture of sustainability by extending the lifecycle of products, reducing waste, 
and providing an accessible and convenient alternative to purchasing new items. 
EcoFinds envisions becoming the go-to destination for a conscious community seeking 
unique finds and responsible consumption. 

Mission: 
        The mission for the hackathon team is to develop a user-friendly and 
engaging desktop and mobile application that serves as a central hub for buying and 
selling second-hand items. EcoFinds should leverage intuitive design and essential 
features to connect buyers and sellers efficiently, promoting a circular economy and 
making sustainable choices easier for everyone. This involves building a platform that is 
both functional and inspires trust and community.
